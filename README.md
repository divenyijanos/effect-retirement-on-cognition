Repo for my paper on the effect of retirement on cognitive performance

Contains my preliminary draft of the paper and the Stata codes:
* merge.do - used to merge different parts of different waves of SHARE
* derive_clean.do - put together the data of merged waves for analysis (create some useful new variables)
* replication_MP.do - replicate and put into context the results of Mazzonna-Perachi (2012)
* panel_regressions.do - do the panel analysis (differences)
* cs_graphs.do - do graphs in cross-section, wave 1
* panel_graphs.do - do graphs on panel
